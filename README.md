We could not find either of Eurivision 1 and 2 files in the upf bucket
##Benchmarking
In order to get the elapsed time of the program, 
we have used the Duration and Instant classes from java.time
We have had no difficulties performing the operation, as both classes
have very clear documentations.
<br/><br/>
We have two ways to get the elapsed time of the program:
running mvn package or using a custom configuration on
IntelliJ in order to provide the program with CLI arguments

File sizes have been tested to be consistent both locally and in S3, which
hints that local files include metadata while S3 does not.
